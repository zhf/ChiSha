This repo is worth nothing than a story.

A few years ago, when I was learning asp.net, every night I got asked by my wife: "What would you like to have tonight?" Later I lost interest in answering such questions, and this program was born.

Inside the repo, you will find nothing than a menu of Chinese food and an asp.net button to generate a list of random choices.
